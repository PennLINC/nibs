"""Plot the layered scalar dependency graph, intermediate derivatives included.

This is the layered counterpart to plot_workflow_modality_sets.py. That figure
reads scalar_modalities.json, where every scalar is attributed straight back to
the acquisitions it ultimately comes from, so a scalar set is one hop from its
modalities. Here the source is scalar_modalities_layered.json, where a scalar may
depend on other scalars: R2' comes from R2* and R2, the g-ratios come from ihMT
and NODDI, and chi-separation with a measured R2' comes from MEGRE and R2'.

A scalar something else depends on is drawn as its own node, so the reused
derivatives are visible instead of being folded into their consumers. Scalars
nothing depends on are still grouped by their exact dependency signature, which
keeps the 53 dMRI maps and the 14 R2*-only QSM maps to one box each. Two things
override that: scalars in KEEP_GROUPED stay inside their group even though
something depends on them, and MERGES draws distinct scalars as one node.

Columns are dependency depth: source modalities, then scalars one hop out, then
two, then three. The layout is the standard three-step layered drawing, so
nothing below the column assignment is hand-placed:

1. Any edge spanning more than one column is split into single-column hops
   around waypoint nodes (``build_routing``). A waypoint takes a real slot in
   each column it crosses, which is what keeps MEGRE -> chi-separation from
   cutting through the level 1 and 2 boxes on its way to level 3.
2. Column order is chosen to minimise edge crossings (``minimise_crossings``),
   by repeated median sweeps plus adjacent-swap refinement. Only MODALITY_ORDER
   is held fixed, as the reading order for the figure.
3. Heights are relaxed toward the mean of each node's neighbours without
   disturbing that order (``place_column``), so edges stay short.

Every edge is then routed the same way (``edge_polyline``): flat across each
column, at the height of the box it leaves, the waypoint it was given, or the box
it lands on, and turning only in the gutters in between, where there is nothing
to hit. Because each turn leaves and arrives level, a segment can never bow
outside the span of its own two ends, so no edge can cross a box it does not
belong to. ``check_no_box_intrusions`` asserts exactly that at draw time.

MPRAGE T1w is the sMRIPrep anatomical reference, so it feeds everything. Drawing
that to every scalar node would bury the data flow, so the pale backbone edges
stop at the first scalar layer and the legend covers the rest.
