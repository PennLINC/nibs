# Manuscript analysis workflow

The numbered directories encode the manuscript-analysis order. Commands use
the reusable source derivatives for scalar images and the selected run output
namespace for all newly computed products.

1. `00_prepare_inputs/01_mni_ribbon_masks`: create subject-specific MNI ribbon
   masks used by GM/WM effect sizes and subject-mask voxel correlations.
2. `00_prepare_inputs/02_dkt_parcel_stats`: summarize scalar maps in DKT
   parcels after DKT warping.
3. `00_prepare_inputs/03_bundle_myelin_stats`: summarize T1w-space scalar maps
   within warped AutoTrack bundles.
4. `01_missingness`: build the Figure 2 acquisition-availability table.
5. `02_gm_wm_differentiation`: compute Figure 3 and Figure S2 effect sizes.
6. `03_correlations`: compute voxelwise and parcel/bundle correlations for
   Figure 4 and Figures S3-S6.
7. `04_icc`: compute parcel/bundle and voxelwise ICC for Figure 5 and Figures
   S7-S11.
8. `05_discriminability`: compute voxelwise and parcel/bundle discriminability
   for Table 4 and Figure S12.

The two regional-statistic preparation branches can run in parallel after the
corresponding processing products exist. ICC and discriminability branches can
also run in parallel once their shared input summaries are complete.
