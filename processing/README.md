# Processing workflow

Directory numbers encode dependency order. Parallel modality branches have
their own folders and SBATCH entry points.

## Reproduction boundary

A manuscript reproduction begins at `03_registration_and_warping`, after all
source scalar maps exist. The following top-level derivative datasets are
reusable, read-only inputs:

- `smriprep`, `qsiprep`, and `qsirecon`
- `pymp2rage`, `ihmt`, `mese`, `megre`, and `qsm`
- `t1wt2w_ratio`, `q_ratio`, and `g_ratio`

Later products are isolated below the selected profile's
`output_derivatives_dir`. Changing that one setting protects the original
manuscript results during replication.

## Run order

1. `00_pull_apptainer_images.sh` downloads containers to the sibling
   `<project_root>/apptainer` directory.
2. `01_smri_dmri/01_submit_smriprep.sbatch` creates anatomical derivatives.
3. `01_smri_dmri/02_submit_qsiprep.sbatch` preprocesses diffusion MRI.
4. `01_smri_dmri/03_submit_qsirecon.sbatch` generates diffusion scalar maps.
5. `02_other_metric_processing/` generates the other reusable source scalars.
   Each modality folder is independently SBATCHable. Within `08_g_ratio`, run
   `01_submit_scaling_factors.sbatch`, `02_aggregate_scaling_factors.sbatch`,
   and `03_submit_g_ratio.sbatch` in that order.
6. `03_registration_and_warping/01_submit_t1w_registration.sbatch` creates the
   ACPC↔T1w transforms in the run output namespace.
7. After step 6 succeeds, the DKT atlas and bundle branches may run in parallel:
   `02_submit_dkt_atlas_warping.sbatch` and
   `03_submit_bundle_warping.sbatch`.
8. `04_quality_control/` contains coregistration, scalar, and consolidated
   analysis-input QC reports. QC is a processing concern and is not duplicated
   under `analysis/`.

Every launcher loads `MIRROR_CONFIG` through
`configuration/load_profile.sh`. Cluster-specific Python executables and
modules can be selected with environment variables such as `PYTHON_BIN` and
`MATLAB_MODULE` without editing tracked scripts.

Run `configuration/create_log_directories.sh` once after cloning and submit
all SBATCH launchers from the repository root. Their relative output paths
write scheduler logs below the checkout's ignored `logs/` directory, grouped
by Slurm job name.

`environment_processing.yml` contains the direct Python and MRtrix
dependencies used by retained code. Site-provided commands remain external:
Apptainer, the ANTs command-line tools, MATLAB/SEPIA, FreeSurfer, `trxrs`, and
`antsApplyTransformsToTRX`. The source-scalar ihMT script also expects the
project-specific `ihmt_proc` Python API. That API is not needed for the
documented replication, which begins after source-scalar generation.
